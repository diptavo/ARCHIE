# Running instructions

We have provided an example run of ARCHIE for demonstration purposes. The individual application and customization would critically depend on the particular application. We encourage the user to closely follow the outlined algorithm in the [preprint](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.29.20204388v2) to adapt it to their cases.
